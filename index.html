        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5"> Psychologist </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a psychologist that works with family and children. I enjoy my work because I am able to apply my passion for mental health and good home environments. Many times, I find myself speaking at seminars and meeting other psychologists when I have free time. Families usually come to me when they have difficulty and disputes that need to be settled. I also hold workshops to allow families to open up and work out their problems with games and activities. My passion for working with kids stems from my background and the support of my own family. My mother was a preschool director for around a decade, and I grew up watching her care for others and their wellbeing. My mother also has a PHD in psychology and also works a Biola University working in early childhood curriculum development. I think it is imperative to remember that while stitches and surgery can fix the outside, a perfectly healthy body doesn’t mean anything if one is mentally unstable.<br><br>

       In my free time and days off, I usually visit the local orphanage and counsel the children for free. Being that they do not have parents and waiting to be adopted, they usually struggle mentally more than the average child with a healthy and “normal” family relationship. The director of the orphanage and I keep in contact to keep tabs of the children with mental illnesses such as autism and depression to make sure they are getting the proper care that they need. Also, I have had the opportunity to attend some rehabilitation meetings and collect data of which methods are the best to help and addict recover and stay away from relapse. Some research that I have just started focuses on Alzheimer patients and am working towards finding a cure or some medicine to delay the effects of Alzheimer’s. On a normal day I see up to 5 patients a day and 2 family meetings. When I am not meeting patients, I am replying to emails or reviewing better ways to help out my patients for the next day. <br><br>

        I am currently working on a book and collaborating with my peers and experts in psychology. We are interested in the way the human mind functions when one experiences anxiety, depression, and how that leads to panic attacks and other problems. Not only do we gather information about others and research, we also take into account our own experiences. In preparation for our book, we have made a website with articles written by the other authors. We make it a point to meet at least once a month and video chat in order to see our progress. I think that it is important to be able to make the negative stigma around mental illnesses go away because it is something that a lot of people go through. People that are struggling through metal illnesses should know that they do not have to deal with it by themselves. I want to be able to make a difference.
